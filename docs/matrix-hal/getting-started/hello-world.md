## Basic Examples
Basic examples can be found inside the `demo` directory inside of the repository that you cloned during [installation](./installation). Below we'll get you started with the Everloop demo which should turn the LEDs a `blue` color.
```
# should already be in ~/matrix-creator-hal/build directory.
cd demos

# run the everloop demo
./everloop_demo

# see the rest of the examples
ls -l
```
