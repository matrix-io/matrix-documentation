# MATRIX Ecosystem Overview

The MATRIX Ecosystem was created to make powerful hardware projects very approachable for software developers. The pillars of MATRIX, computer vision, hardware interfaces, distributed internet communication, and data-driven end-user clients, are all programming disciplines which require years for an individual to master, or for a team to build a solution around.

MATRIX provides powerful capabilities in an environment which adapts to your use-case and capacity.
 
With MATRIX OS, you can write an application in an hour, deploy to your devices in seconds, and publish for a worldwide audience with a keypress.

With MATRIX CORE, you can integrate MATRIX hardware with your favorite languages and libraries.

With MATRIX HAL, you can work with the low-level fundamentals of MATRIX hardware to have it function the way you want. 

## MATRIX OS
Top-level application management layer which integrates with the MATRIX Creator hardware via MATRIX CORE.

## MATRIX CORE
C++ abstraction layer for HAL. Hosts the ZeroMQ communication layer which makes the sensors accessible via high-level interfaces. Supports 40+ different languages, C++, Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, etc.
