## Troubleshooting

Please visit our community support forums at:
[community.matrix.one](http://community.matrix.one/)

Starting MOS from your device, you will have access to more error messages with `DEBUG=*,-engine*,-Component*` prepended to the commands presented below. `engine`, refers to `engine.io`, sockets, and `Component`, is very verbose hardware communications, disable these filters as necessary.

### Test applications
Several applications are available in the [MATRIX App Store](https://apps.matrix.one).

* `sensorTest` - Tests all sensors
* `clock` - Runs a clock which tests the LEDs
* `faceTest` - Face detection services via `malos-eye`.

### Lights are spinning, but don't stop

Exits with message
```
Device Error undefined
```
Solution. Run again with correct environment set. Users and made in `dev` environment do notÂ cross over to `production`.
```
NODE_ENV =dev node index.js
```

### MATRIX Vision Services not working
Messages appear when `malos_eye` is running, and hardware is not properly installed. Please shut off device, firmly reconnect the camera connection, and restart.
