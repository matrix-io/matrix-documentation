## MATRIX OS (MOS)

MATRIX OS manages Javascript-based applications on MATRIX devices. MOS should start automatically with your MATRIX device, which, if not yet configured, will be indicated by a pulsing blue light.

Read more about [MATRIX OS Applications](overview/applications.md)

### Using MATRIX OS

MOS devices and applications can be managed and observed via the [MATRIX Dashboard](http://dash.matrix.one), or via mobile apps on Android and iOS. 

Initially, a device using MOS must be registered with MATRIX Labs. Instructions for this is available in [Pairing](getting-started/pairing).

To learn more about applications, tooling and the dashboard, start at [Overview](overview/index.md)

### Developing MATRIX Applications

> To develop on MOS, you should have some familiarity with JavaScript and how to do command line operations. 

See [Prerequisites](getting-started/prerequisites.md) 

First, install the [Command Line Tool](../overview/cli.md) and register your device, either via CLI or mobile app.

After your device is registered, the best place to start with developing MOS applications is [Hello World](getting-started/hello-world.md). This will get you familiar with the MOS application-device workflow. 

Then visit [Next Steps](getting-started/next-steps.md) to build some [examples](examples/index.md), or dive into the [reference](reference/index.md)
