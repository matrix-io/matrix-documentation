## Configuration

Every MOS application has a configuration file `config.yaml`.

This file:

1. Sets meta information for the application, which is displayed in the [MATRIX App Store](http://apps.matrix.one).
1. Identifies which sensors, services, events and integrations an application utilizes.
1. Generates a policy on install, asking the user for particular access to their device.
1. Defines dynamic settings variables, which are available to the application and end-user modifiable.
