# Overview

MATRIX OS (MOS) is open source software for hosting IoT applications. MATRIX OS runs on node.js, and initially, applications will be written in JavaScript, however, as we finish writing SDK's, other languages will be supported. Python is first up.

## Applications

Fundamentally, MATRIX OS applications logically connect hardware with machine learning abstractions. In this way, you can connect the output from a computer vision system to drive real-world behavior in the form of hardware signaling. You can also use internet API's and integrations, such as IFTTT to further customize your application, for yourself, or for end-users.

## Dashboard

MOS applications optionally include a dashboard for exploring data.

## Configuration
In order to make MOS applications flexible, powerful, and discoverable, each application has an associated file, `config.yaml` which sets the meta information needed for an application to execute safely and consistently.

## Command Line Interface
Along with mobile applications and the dashboard, the Command Line Interface (CLI) enables you to manage your MATRIX device and associated applications. If you want to develop MATRIX OS applications, you need to use the CLI to manage different aspects of the development lifecycle.
