## Initial Pairing

The easiest way to start using MATRIX OS is to pair it using Bluetooth on your mobile phone.

1. Download the MATRIX application
1. Turn on your MATRIX+Pi (lights should pulse blue after a minute if MOS is running properly)
1. Add a new device ( lights will flash green )
1. Add Name, description and Wifi information (if desired)

Proceed to [Hello World!](hello-world.md) to install an application.
